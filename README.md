# Infinity Scroll

This project demonstrates how to implement an infinite scrolling feature using the Unsplash API. The project uses JavaScript to fetch a set of random images from the API and display them in an image gallery on the web page. As the user scrolls down the page, more images are loaded dynamically, providing a seamless user experience.

## How to Use

- Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
- Get your own access key from Unsplash Developer.
- Replace the placeholder access key in script.js with your own access key.
- Open index.html in your web browser to see the image gallery.
- Scroll down to see more images loaded dynamically.
